<p>Browsers read HTML, CSS, and JavaScript natively. Every other language is used to generate these three types of files. Static sites are created from hard-coded static files that do not rely on any server processes (unlike PHP or any other server-side-generated sites). Jekyll, the underlying framework, instead relies on the content editor's local environment to generate the static files that will eventually be deployed.</p>
